    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Ramen is a Japanese noodle soup dish featuring wheat noodles in a flavorful broth, often seasoned with soy sauce
        or miso, and topped with various ingredients like pork, seaweed, and green onions. It's a customizable dish with
        diverse regional variations and broth types, including Shoyu (soy sauce), Shio (salt), Miso, and Tonkotsu (pork
        bone). </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons spicy sesame oil</li>
        <li>2 (1x3-inch) boneless pork chop slices</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon black sesame seeds, divided</li>
        <li>2 leaves fresh basil, chopped, divided</li>
        <li>1 leaf fresh sage, chopped, divided</li>
        <li>1 (3 ounce) package instant ramen noodles, seasoning packet discarded</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons shredded dried kombu</li>
        <li>1 ¾ tablespoons bonito soup stock</li>
        <li>1 ¾ tablespoons soy sauce (shoyu)</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon white miso paste with dashi</li>
        <li>4 1/3-inch slices fish paste stick (naruto)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon tonkatsu sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sushi ginger (shoga), finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 green onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Fill a small pot halfway with water. Bring to a boil; add egg and cook in boiling water for 15 minutes.
            Drain. Run cold water over egg and set aside to cool.</li>
        <li>Pour sesame oil into a large skillet. Lay pork slices in oil. Cover pork with 1 tablespoon olive oil, 1/2
            tablespoon sesame seeds, 1/2 of the basil, and 1/2 of the sage. Flip and cover pork with these remaining
            ingredients: 1 tablespoon olive oil, 1/2 tablespoon sesame seeds, basil, and sage.</li>
        <li>Cook pork, covered, over medium-low heat, until evenly browned on the bottom, about 5 minutes. Flip and
            continue cooking until second side is browned, about 5 minutes more. Remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook ramen noodles in boiling water until tender, about 3 minutes.
            Drain in a colander set in the sink; rinse noodles until water runs clear. Return noodles to the pot.</li>
        <li>Stir kombu, bonito stock, soy sauce, and miso paste into noodles. Cook, stirring with chopsticks, over
            medium heat, until miso paste is dissolved, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer noodles to a serving bowl.</li>
        <li>Peel and cut egg in half lengthwise. Place egg, pork slices, and fish paste slices over noodles. Garnish
            with tonkatsu sauce, ginger, green onion, and black pepper.</li>
